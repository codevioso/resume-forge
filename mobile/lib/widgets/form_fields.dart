/// you" and "Skills" were the same colour. A section is always the colour it
/// was the last time you scrolled past it, so the colour is worth learning.
///
/// The order below is also the order the sections appear in, and the tints are
/// assigned so that no two *adjacent* cards are close in hue: slate, rust,
/// moss, ochre, teal, plum. Scrolling from Experience to Education crosses a
/// red-brown to a green, not two greens.

///
/// The model keeps one free-text `phone` string and the templates print it
/// verbatim. This field presents that string as two controls — the country code
/// and the rest of the number — and puts it back together with
/// [joinPhoneNumber] on every keystroke. Nothing is reformatted, regrouped or
/// "corrected" on the way through: a resume number the app silently rewrote
/// into an undialable one would be a far worse defect than an oddly spaced one.
///
/// ## A stored number with no `+`
///
/// [splitPhoneNumber] reports a **null country** for any stored string that
/// does not start with `+` — which is every resume saved before this field
/// existed. Null does not mean "use the default"; it means the whole string is
/// the number the user has. So the code control reads "None", the entire string
/// stays in the number field, and typing writes it back with nothing added. A
/// dial code is only ever put in front of an existing number when the user
/// picks one, because doing it for them would invent digits they never typed.
///
/// An **empty** field is the one place a country is chosen for them: there is
/// no number to corrupt, [joinPhoneNumber] stores nothing until they type, and
/// the code is on screen beside the field before the first keystroke. It comes
/// from the locale region through [phoneCountryForRegion], which is documented
/// as a visible, cheap-to-change guess rather than a finding.
///
/// ## A whole number typed into the number field
///
/// A leading `+` is taken at its word. Someone pasting `+44 20 7946 0018` has
/// given a complete number, and joining the selected code onto the front of it
/// would store `+1 +44 20 7946 0018`; instead the string is stored exactly as
/// pasted and the code control follows it. This is the only place the field
/// moves text the user typed, it only ever moves a dial code from the number
/// into the control beside it, and it waits until a code has actually resolved
/// — `+4` on the way to `+41` stays where it was typed.
///
/// ## A guessed country
///
/// `+1` covers 25 countries and [PhoneNumberParts.isGuess] says when the one
/// that came back was the table's fallback rather than a real resolution. The
/// control shows the dial code either way — that much was read off the user's
/// own text — but it only *names* the country when the answer was real, and
/// opening the picker on a guess marks no row as chosen and pre-fills the
/// search with the shared code instead. The app does not answer a question it
/// cannot.
///
/// ## Validation
///
/// There is none, deliberately. [checkPhoneNumber] asks the much smaller
/// question of whether a string could be a phone number at all, and what it
/// finds appears as a note under the field *after* the user has moved on — not
/// as an error, not on the keystroke that provoked it, and never as a reason to
