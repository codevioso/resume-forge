/// **This palette is app chrome only.** Resume templates carry their own
/// independent document palettes and must never read from this [ColorScheme] —
/// a resume printed in the app's aqua would be a defect, not a feature. The
/// two colour worlds stay strictly separate: this file styles the frame,
/// `templates/` styles the page inside it. Eleven of the thirteen designs are
/// light documents, so with a near-black frame the boundary is visible at a
/// glance: anything white on screen is the page, everything tinted is chrome.
///
/// **Nothing here is a gradient, and nothing here is glossy.** Depth comes from
/// flat, solid tints stepped against a neutral near-black — see
/// [AppTokens.cardTints] — and from one saturated accent. There is no ramp on
/// any surface, no glow under any mark, and no shadow under any panel. That is
/// the whole design: matte.
///
/// The base is deliberately *neutral* black rather than a tinted one. `#0E0E10`
/// has R and G equal and B two steps up, which is as much blue as it may carry
/// before it starts reading as the navy this palette replaced.
